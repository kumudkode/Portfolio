An ultra-premium, editorial-style portfolio designed by Kumud Ranjan, a Full Stack Engineer and Cloud Specialist. This project focuses on high-performance motion design, minimalist "Paper" aesthetics, and a sophisticated developer-centric user experience.

🎨 Design Philosophy

The website follows a Swiss Editorial approach, moving away from standard grid-based templates to create a unique digital experience that feels like a high-end design magazine.

Tactile Feeling: A custom "Paper Grain" overlay adds physical texture to the UI.

Color Theory: A minimalist palette using #f7f7f7 (Premium Paper) and #ff4d00 (Designer Orange) for high-contrast accents.

Typography: Pairs the elegant Instrument Serif with the technical Space Mono and clean Inter.

Kinetic Interaction: Every movement on the site follows mathematical easing curves to ensure a fluid, "weighted" feel.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Core: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Layout & Design)

Animation: GSAP (GreenSock) for high-performance motion and ScrollTrigger for reveal effects.

Smooth Scroll: Lenis for professional kinetic scrolling.

Typography: Google Fonts (Instrument Serif, Space Mono, Inter).

Icons: Custom SVG and CSS-based components.

✨ Key Features

Dynamic Logo Interaction: The logo KumudKode features an automated cycling animation that switches between KODE, CODE, DEV, and SYSTEM.

Ultra-Premium Custom Cursor: A dual-element cursor (blob and ring) that adapts size and color based on the interactive element being hovered.

Magnetic Buttons: Calls-to-action utilize a magnetic physics effect, drawing the cursor in and responding to mouse proximity.

Automated Pre-loader: A branded initialization sequence that ensures all assets are ready before the experience begins.

Responsive Architecture: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using a 12-column liquid grid system.
